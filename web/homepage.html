            This is a picture of my realm in Minecraft. I have been playing minecraft for many years, and built many different things.  This realm is my current project.
            I share this realm with my family, some of which are out of state.  The nice thing about a realm in Minecraft is that it is on a dedicated server, so it is cloud
            based.  Anyone who has access to the realm can get on at anytime from anywhere and play. I also play other video games, but Minecraft is my main game I play.

        <p class="write">
            I love the outdoors, especially in the forest. Getting out and enjoying nature is a very relaxing activity to me.  Camping is just one way to get outdoors.
            I also like to go fishing and hiking.  The picture is from a lookout spot near one of my favorite camping sites.

        <p class="write">
            My family is the most important thing in my life.  Everything that we do in the church is about family.  God has made family a priority for all of his children.
            One of the greatest truths we bear record of in the church is that families can be together forever.  I would be completely lost without my family.
